about_intro: My goal is to make significant contributions to the **teaching and
  learning of astronomy** at the undergraduate level.
about_body: I received my Bachelor's Degree in Geophysical Sciences from the
  **University of Chicago** in 2013. I went on to get a Masters Degree and Ph.D.
  in Planetary Sciences from the **University of Arizona** (in 2016 and 2019,
  respectively). During my time as a graduate student, I became interested in
  how general education science students approach concepts taught to them in
  their astronomy courses. I decided to pursue a **Certificate in College
  Teaching** through the University of Arizona's Office of Instruction and
  Assessment. This led me on the path to pursue Astronomy Education Research
  full-time, and after graduation, I began a position as a Postdoctoral
  Researcher for the [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) at the **Adler
  Planetarium**. As a Professor at ASU, I utilize citizen science as tool to
  bring authentic data-rich experiences to students in both in-person and online
  courses. I also develop active learning materials designed to engage students
  in critical thinking that promotes a level of understanding beyond rote
  memorization.
