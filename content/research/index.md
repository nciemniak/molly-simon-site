research_intro: My research focuses predominantly on utilizing citizen science
  as a tool to bring authentic data-rich experiences to undergraduates, both in
  person and online.
research_body: >-
  I began my career as a planetary scientist, focusing predominantly on planet
  formation and the role of winds in clearing protoplanetary material. Later in
  my career, however, I transitioned into Discipline-Based Education Research
  (DBER) with an astronomy/planetary sciences focus. 


  My current projects utilize citizen science as a tool to bring authentic data to undergraduates at different stages of their career.

    description: >-
      For this effort, my research team and I develop data-rich classroom
      activities for undergraduate non-science majors that involve contributing
      to citizen science projects active on the
      [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) platform. Students learn about
      topics at the forefront of current disciplinary research and immerse
      themselves in a variety of representations (charts, tables, figures) to
      better understand the process real scientists undergo when answering
      complex research questions. Labs have been completed on the topics of
      transiting exoplanets and climate change utilizing the Zooniverse projects
      [Planet Hunters -
      TESS](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/nora-dot-eisner/planet-hunters-tess)
      and [Floating
      Forests](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/floating-forests),
      respectively. We are currently developing two additional activities with
      an emphasis on culturally responsive curricular development on the topics
      of Martian weather and climate ([Planet
      Four](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/mschwamb/planet-four)) and
      gravitation waves ([Gravity
      Spy](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zooniverse/gravity-spy)). After
      the pilot testing phase is complete, these curricular materials will be
      available on the [Zooniverse classroom page
      ](https://classroom.zooniverse.org/#/)for public access.

  - project_title: Developing an Online Research Course for Astronomy Majors
    description: >-
      In this effort, we are developing the first fully online research course
      for astronomy majors. Utilizing [Exoplanet
      Watch](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exoplanet-watch/about-exoplanet-watch/overview/)
      (a high-level citizen science project through NASA's Jet Propulsion
      Laboratory) and [DIY Planet
      Search](https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/research/diy-planet-search#:~:text=The%20DIY%20Planet%20Search%20is,involved%20in%20the%20exoplanet%20hunt.)
      (a tool built out of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics), our
      online students will be using robotic ground-based telescopes to take
      follow-up observations of large, previously-discovered exoplanets. Using
      the tools provided by Exoplanet Watch and DIY Planet Search, these
      students will update the orbital properties of these exoplanets, and post
      them to a well-renowned national database. These updated parameters will
      help future space-based missions (like JWST and ARIEL) observe these giant
      exoplanets more precisely to help scientists learn more about distant
      planet atmospheres.

  - project_title: "The Development and Validation of the Planet Formation Concept Inventory "
    description: We investigated [college students’ conceptual and reasoning
      difficulties](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2017.1815) on
      the topic of planet formation pre-instruction. Through an analysis of over
      1,000 responses to open-ended questions, we found that these students lack
      an understanding of fundamental topics in astronomy (e.g. gravity, basic
      definitions of a planet or solar system, mass versus density). The results
      from this analysis laid the foundation for the development of the [Planet
      Formation Concept Inventory
      (PFCI)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09500693.2019.1685140),
      an educational research tool that can be used like a diagnostic test to
      assess students’ pre- and post-instructional knowledge. Using iterative
      design and statistical processes consistent with Classical Test Theory
      (CTT), we were able to confirm that the PFCI is a reliable and valid
      instrument that can be utilized to measure college students’ learning on
      the topic of planet formation over time.

  - project_title: "Evidence for Magnetically Driven Protoplanetary Disk Winds "
    figure: /uploads/download.jpg
    description: >-
      We [analyzed forbidden
      lines](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/831/2/169/meta)
      (predominantly the \[O i] line at 6300 A) from a sample of 33 T-Tauri
      stars with disks spanning a range of evolutionary stages. After removing a
      high-velocity component (HVC) associated with microjets, we focused our
      efforts on studying the low-velocity component (LVC) to better elucidate
      its origin. 


      The LVC can be attributed to slow disk winds that are either thermally or magnetically driven. We found that the LVC itself can be resolved into two distinct components: a broad component (FWHM > 40 km/s) and a narrow component (FWHM < 40 km/s). Additionally, we found that the FWHM 15 of both components correlates with the disk inclination, consistent with Keplerian broadening from radii of 0.05 to 0.5 AU for the BC and 0.5 to 5 AU for the NC. Since the BC emission arises inward of 0.5 AU where the gravity of the star/disk system is strong, we eliminated the possibility that the BC traces a thermally-driven wind, and instead suggested that it traces the base of a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wind. For the NC, half of the features we observed had centroid velocities consistent with the stellar velocity, and the other half had blueshifts between -2 and -5 km/s. For this component of the LVC, the origin remains more elusive, and we could not exclude the possibility that the NC arises in a photoevaporative wind.

  - name: Christine O’Donnell
    about: Christine O’Donnell (she/her) is a Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion
      for learning how the Universe works and sharing that knowledge with
      others. Her Ph.D. dissertation was a combination of (1) research into
      **galaxy formation** leveraging the power of both observations and
      simulations and (2) research into developing a framework for
      inclusivity-driven education in a general-education astronomy course. At
      ASU, she develops, implements, and assesses curricular materials that
      promote **equitable science education** through culturally responsive
      approaches. Her work is designed to empower learners to connect science
      with their personal/sociocultural identities and thus guides them to
      become social justice change agents.
