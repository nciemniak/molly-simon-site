postdoc_researchers:
  - name: Christine O’Donnell
    about: Christine O’Donnell (she/her) is a Postdoctoral Researcher with a passion
      for learning how the Universe works and sharing that knowledge with
      others. Her Ph.D. dissertation was a combination of (1) research into
      **galaxy formation** leveraging the power of both observations and
      simulations and (2) research into developing a framework for
      inclusivity-driven education in a general-education astronomy course. At
      ASU, she develops, implements, and assesses curricular materials that
      promote **equitable science education** through culturally responsive
      approaches. Her work is designed to empower learners to connect science
      with their personal/sociocultural identities and thus guides them to
      become social justice change agents.

grad_students:
  - name: Peter Smith
    about: Peter is an Astrophysics PhD student in ASU's School of Earth and Space
      Exploration. He is a native Texan and earned his BS in astrophysics from
      the University of Texas in 2020. His primary research focuses on
      ground-based characterization of **planets outside our solar system**.
      Within SESE's Astronomy Education Research Group, Peter is working to
      develop a culturally responsive and inclusive curricular model to be
      combined with citizen science based classroom activities. Through his
      research, Peter intends to address barriers to participation in the
      natural sciences for students who do not identify with majority groups. In
      his free time, he loves to bake or be outdoors.

  - name: Haylee Archer
    about: Haylee Archer (she/her) is an Astrophysics PhD student in ASU's School of
      Earth and Space Exploration whose primary research is studying star
      formation in **dwarf irregular galaxies**. She holds a Master’s in Science
      Teaching and works with Dr. Simon for her secondary project assessing the
      efficacy of different active learning strategies in introductory astronomy
      courses. She is passionate about making science accessible and
      comprehensible to all students.

  - name: "Isaac Rosenthal "
    about: Isaac is a PhD student in the School for the Environment at University of
      Massachusetts Boston. He was connected to Dr. Simon through their mutual
      work on citizen science at The Zooniverse, where they developed classroom
      curricula to pair with online citizen science projects. Much of Isaac’s
      research focuses on the intersection of natural and human systems. He
      tries to leverage natural history, social factors, and modern analytical
      techniques to learn about global change. In addition to his work with Dr.
      Simon, he is also a trail guide and an AAUS certified diver with
      contributions to many long term academic and citizen science field
      monitoring projects.
